![pandemi](image/closed.gif)![sad](image/sad.gif) 

On the ILO (International Labor Organization) [report](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/briefingnote/wcms_755910.pdf), it is predicted that at least 490 million workers have lost or reduced their working hours due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Including here in Indonesia, many people have lost their source of income due to this pandemic. But not a few are trying to find new opportunities by opening small businesses. Various ways have been done to promote their business and of course social media has become a favorite platform to use. Instagram as one of the social media with the largest users in Indonesia is the main choice.

One of Instagram's great features for promotion is **Instagram Story** with various interesting **Filters**. In this tutorial we will try to create a **Filter** which can be used for promotion. This **Filter** will be in the form of a **Promo Card** which can be easily modified with an image or photo that the user has prepared himself for each promotion program.

We try to design this tutorial to be applied by users who are new to coding or have never even used **Spark AR Studio**, so hopefully it can help those who are looking for new opportunities in the midst of this pandemic.

This tutorial will cover 3 main things:

* Preparation and how to install **Spark AR Studio**
* Create a simple **Filter** in the form of a **Promo Card** with the **Gallery Texture** feature, where later the user can use their own image or photo on the **Filter**.
* Testing and the steps to publish **Filter** that we have created.

We hope that after following this tutorial you will be able to create your own filter that works well and managed to publish it.
